                Problem Statement
            </h3>
            <br />
            <h4>
                The usage of water and electricity has increased in Victoria due to the impacts of Covid-19 and climate change since last year.
                Most Victorian families are suffering from financial hardship and have to pay an increased amount of utility bills. 
                They want to find an environmentally friendly solution that can reduce their utility usage.

                Proposed Solution
            </h3>
            <br />
            <h4>
                A web application that provides you with information about solar panels and water recycling systems, and besides that, 
                we will provide you with a multifunctional calculator which allows you to calculate the potential energy saving. 
                In addition, VicEnerG will help Victorian families improve their awareness of environmental protection by estimating their 
                carbon dioxide emissions and demonstrate how these carbon dioxide emissions impact their daily life.
