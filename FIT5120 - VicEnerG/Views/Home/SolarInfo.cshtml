                <h3>What is Solar?</h3>
                <h4>
                    There are two main types of solar energy: solar thermal and solar photovoltaic. Solar thermal uses solar radiation to heat air or liquid, such as solar water heating. Solar photovoltaic, or called PV solar is made when you convert sunlight into electricity. Solar panels absorb light and use it in a way that creates electricity.

                <h4>
                    A solar panel is full of photovoltaic solar cells. When sunlight reaches each cell, it ‘excites’ electrons in the cells, causing them to move. Moving electrons equal the electrical energy. The energy moves out of the panels and into a solar inverter.

                <h4>
                    Solar energy is sustainable. Solar is a kind of renewable energy, which does not use finite resources, such as fossil fuels. The process of creating electricity in solar panels does not cause any pollution.

                <h4>
                    Solar energy can reduce electricity bills. Many states require utilities to offer net metering, which allows homeowners to offset their electric costs with the energy their solar panels produce.

                <h4>
                    The average Victorian home has real solar generator potential - plenty of sunlight, with plenty of room to install solar panels. In 2020 alone, Victorian rooftops added 3 GW of rooftop solar capacity across almost 380,000 installations, which was a bigger increase than any other year.

                    The figure above shows the monthly solar panel installations in Victoria in 2020. From January to June, the number of installations is about 6000. Since July, the number of solar panels installed has suddenly dropped to about 3,000. In October, the number of solar panels installed reached its peak, exceeding 9,000. From November to December, the number of solar panels installed slightly decreased.
