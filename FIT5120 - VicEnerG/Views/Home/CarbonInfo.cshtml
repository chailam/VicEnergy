                <h4>
                    A carbon footprint is the total amount of greenhouse gases (including CO2 and methane) that are generated by our actions.  It includes environmental impacts, such as water use and the amount of land used for food production. In contrast, a carbon footprint is usually expressed as a measure of weight, as in tons of CO2 or CO2 equivalent per year.

                    The main source of Victoria’s emissions is burning fossil fuels – like coal, oil and gas – for energy and transport.

                <h4>
                    In 2019, the energy sector accounted for 70% of Victoria’s emissions, transport was responsible for 25%, agriculture emitted 17%, industrial processes and product use represented 4%, and the waste sector accounted for the remaining 4% of Victoria’s emissions. Together, these sectors account for 119% of Victoria’s total net emissions.

                    Notes: Victoria’s forests and natural systems absorbed around 19% of Victoria’s emissions in 2019. This removal of emissions in the Land Use, Land Use Change and Forestry sector gives a total of 100% across all sectors – in other words, produces Victoria’s total net emissions.
