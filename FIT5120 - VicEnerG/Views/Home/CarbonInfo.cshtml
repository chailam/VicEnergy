                <h4>
                    A carbon footprint is the total amount of greenhouse gases (including CO2 and methane) that are generated by our actions.  It includes environmental impacts, such as water use and the amount of land used for food production. In contrast, a carbon footprint is usually expressed as a measure of weight, as in tons of CO2 or CO2 equivalent per year.

                    Victoria’s forests and natural systems absorbed around 19% of Victoria’s emissions in 2019. This removal of emissions in the Land Use, Land Use Change and Forestry sector gives a total of 100% across all sectors – in other words, produces Victoria’s total net emissions.
